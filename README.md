Desperate to cash in on the phone app market and betting that quirky English phrases will become the next meme, you decide to build a Palindrome checker. A palindrome, you no doubt remember, is a phrase that reads the same forwards as backwards (ignoring spaces, capitalization and punctuation). The following are all examples:

<ul>

 <li>Racecar</li>

 <li>Amore, Roma</li>

 <li>A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!</li>

 <li>Was it a cat I saw?</li>

 <li>Never odd or even</li>

</ul>

You are to continually accept a user input string and identify which are a Palindrome. Continue until the user enters the word “done”.

<h1>2. Notes</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Turn in only your source files.</li>

 <li>Do not use a package.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="3">

 <li><strong>Required Main Class </strong>Palindrome <strong>4.</strong> <strong>Required Input </strong></li>

</ol>

A series of user entered prospective palindromes, including the final input “done”.

<h1>5. Required Output</h1>

Your output should look something like the following example. It should include your name.
